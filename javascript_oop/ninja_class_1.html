        <h1>Ninja Class I</h1>
        <p><b>Instructions:</b> Create a new class called Ninja with the following attributes:
            name,
            health,
            speed (private),
            and strength (private).
            Speed and strength should be 3 by default. Health should be 100 by default.

            The Ninja class should have the following methods:

            1.) sayName() - This should log that Ninja's name to the console.
            2.) showStats() - This should show the Ninja's Strength and Speed, as well as their health.
            3.) drinkSake() - This should add +10 Health to the Ninja.</p>
        <p>Check out the console to have fun.</p>
